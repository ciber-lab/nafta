## Introduction 

This repository presents project Nafta, which focuses on oil spill detection and segmentation. In addition, YOLOv3 model is implemented to detect oil rigs and vessels. All models trained on the Nafta dataset can be downloaded [here][Models]. Please read the following article for more detailed information about the project and procedures.

## Nafta Dataset 

[Download the Dataset]

The Nafta dataset contains 1,292 images. In total, 70% of images are taken by drones (low altitude), 16% by satellites (high altitude), and the remaining 14% from first-person views. There are 1,431 instances of the “oil spill” class, 959 instances of the “vessel” class, and 316 instances of the “oil rig” class (See the Venn Diagram Below)
